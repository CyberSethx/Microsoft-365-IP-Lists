## Description

This project provides a comprehensive list of IPv4 addresses and subnets associated with Microsoft 365 services. It aims to assist network administrators in configuring firewalls, proxies, and other network devices to allow or monitor traffic to and from Microsoft 365.

## Features

- Extracted all IPv4 addresses and subnets from official Microsoft 365 documentation.
- Provides the data in a plain text format, with one IP or subnet per line.
- Regularly updated to reflect changes in Microsoft's IP address allocations.

## Usage

- You can directly point to this public lists for example as an external list on your firewall (Below is an example with Fortigate CLI but this can work with a lot more)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or encounter any issues, feel free to post here.
